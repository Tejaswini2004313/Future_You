Future You is a career guidance website designed to provide students with information about new and emerging career fields that are not commonly explored. The platform aims to help students make informed decisions about their future careers by showcasing various unconventional and promising career paths. The project is built using modern web technologies and follows a client-server architecture, utilizing MongoDB Atlas as the database, ReactJS for the frontend, and ExpressJS for the backend.
